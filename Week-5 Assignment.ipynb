When a user starts it up, it should prompt them for a filename. If they enter a file name that doesn't exist, it should prompt them to enter the text they want to write to the file. After they enter the text, it should save the file and exit.If they enter a file name that already exists, it should ask the user if they want: A) Read the file B) Append the file C) Delete the file and start over\n","\n","If the user wants to read the file it should simply show the contents of the file on the screen. If the user wants to start over then the file should be deleted and another empty one made in its place. If a user elects to append the file, then they should be able to enter more text, and that text should be added to the existing text in the file.\n","\n","Note: The software Development Team created partial python code for the above problem statement, you try to help them to complete the code wherever required and produce successful output"],"metadata":{"id":"pm1v-jS02stZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"N1DUGekh2fWL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1655908987294,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":173105,"user":{"displayName":"Rithuparna K D","userId":"14270008570337436212"}},"outputId":"feedf12e-c40c-4aae-d1c3-af5a34fa393b"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Enter The File Name : employee\n","Nope, this file does not exist, I'm going to create it for you! ðŸ˜„\n","file created successfully.\n","write the data:EMPLOYEE_ID,FIRST_NAME\n"]}],"source":["import os\n","filename=input(\"Enter The File Name : \")\n","# Here we check if the file exists\n","if os.path.isfile('./'+filename+\".txt\"):\n","    print(f\"Looking for file:{filename}.txt\")\n","    print(\"Found it\")\n","    action = input(\"Enter the possible file operation: read, append, delete, replace\\n\")\n","    \n","    if action==\"read\":\n","        file=open(filename+\".txt\",'r')\n","        print(file.read())\n","        file.close()\n","        \"\"\"To Do : write the code for file read operation\"\"\"\n","    \n","    elif action==\"append\":\n","        file=open(filename+\".txt\",\"a\")\n","        data=input(\"write the data:\")\n","        file.write(data+\"\\n\")\n","        file.close()\n","        \"\"\"To Do : write the code for file append operation\"\"\"\n","    \n","    elif action == \"delete\":\n","        os.remove(filename+\".txt\")\n","        \"\"\"To Do : write the code for file delete and another empty one made in its place operation\"\"\"\n","    \n","    elif action == \"replace\":\n","        file=open(filename+\".txt\",\"w\")\n","        file.write(\"\")\n","        file.close()\n","        \n","        \n","    else:\n","        print(\"Sorry, unrecognized action ðŸ˜¢\")\n","\n","else:\n","    print(\"Nope, this file does not exist, I'm going to create it for you! ðŸ˜„\")\n","    file=open(filename+\".txt\",\"w\")\n","    print(\"file created successfully.\")\n","    data=input(\"write the data:\")\n","    file.write(data+\"\\n\")\n","    file.close()\n","    \"\"\"To Do : write the code for file create and write the notes \"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q2.Text File Analytics: Q2.1 Assume you as Data Analyst, you need to collect all text file name from current working directory and store the all text file name into \"txtfile_namelist.txt\" and read this file and print How many files are available in that namelist."],"metadata":{"id":"4RJERh4c20Lg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import os\n","count=0\n","file=open(\"txtfile_namelist.txt\",'w+')\n","for i in os.listdir():\n","    if i.endswith(\".txt\"):\n","        file.write(i+\"\\n\")\n","file.seek(0)\n","for j in file.readlines():\n","    print(j)\n","    count+=1\n","file.close()\n","print(f\"Number of text files in the current working directory : {count}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"qHwngaXU3qdA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1655909045245,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":756,"user":{"displayName":"Rithuparna K D","userId":"14270008570337436212"}},"outputId":"5a37f8b6-c962-4271-f44d-c14e92f55e27"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["txtfile_namelist.txt\n","\n","employee.txt\n","\n","Number of text files in the current working directory : 2\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q2.2 write the following contents to zenofpython.txt\n","\n","content:\n","The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters Beautiful is better than ugly.
